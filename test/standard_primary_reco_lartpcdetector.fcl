# File:    standard_primary_reco_lartpcdetector.fcl
# Purpose: simple reconstruction of events for the "standard" LAr TPC detector
# Date:    July 30th, 2015
# Author:  Gianluca Petrillo (petrillo@fnal.gov)
# Version: 0.1 (broken)
# Input:   file with simulated (or real) raw data
# 
# Description:
# Wire signal calibration, hit finding and clustering for the "standard" LAr TPC
# detector.
# 
# This file is currently unusable since LAr TPC detector has no wire calibration
# module.
#
# Changes:
# 20150730 (petrillo@fnal.gov) [v0.1]
#   original version, based on MicroBooNE's "stage 1" reconstruction
