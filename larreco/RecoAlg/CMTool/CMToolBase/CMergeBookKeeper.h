     \class CMergeBookKeeper
     A utility class for CMergeManager which merge clusters using merging algorithms.
     One of major task for CMergeManager is to keep track of which clusters to be merged
     in the original input. CMergeBookKeeper handles this part. It works with indexes. The user
     (primarily CMergeManager) provides number of clusters to CMergeBookKeeper's constructor.
     Then it can ask CMergeBookKeeper to merge two specific clusters by specifying index number
     of the cluster which has to be smaller than the previously specified number of clusters.
     CMergeBookKeeper keeps track of which clusters are asked to merge together, and it can be
     asked to return a vector of merged cluster indexes.
